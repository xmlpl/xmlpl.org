		<section name="Introduction">
      <p>
        Welcome to CompSci497: Advanced XML Programming with XmlPL.
        This is a new course designed to teach you about a new
        Open-Source programming language, data description languages
        in general, XML and a touch of software engineering and
        compiler design.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today XML is widely used and accepted as a standard.  Despite
        this fact few people in the industry seem to really understand
        what the hype is all about.  This class will attempt to cut
        through the hype around XML and get to the real reasons XML
        and data description languages are useful.  You will be
        introduced to XmlPL, a powerful tool for manipulating XML
        data.  By the end of the course you should have a solid
        understanding of XML technologies and a few more tricks in
        your bag that will make you a better and more marketable
        software developer.
      </p>

		<section name="Class Format &amp; Grading">
		  <p>
			  Class will be held for 8 weeks every Friday, except for
        February 16th, from 11:40am-1:30pm in room MEC-309.  There
        will be a 15 minute break from 12:30pm to 12:45pm.
      </p>

      <p>
			  Grading will be based on attendance and completion of the
				programming project.  There is no specific requirement for
				attendance, but the more class you miss the more you will have
				to make up in the programming project.  That said, this is
				only a one credit course so if you attend class regularly the
				programming project will not be too difficult.  Grading is
				pass/fail.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your programming project must be pre-approved.  For a project
        to be approved it should be useful, interesting, appropriate
        for the language, and somewhat challenging.  The program does
        not have to be long in order to meet these criteria and could
        be only a few hundred lines.  In addition, your source code
        must be readable and documented.  You may retain the copyright
        to your source code, but all projects must be publishable on
        the XmlPL website under the GPL license.  Deadlines are at the
				beginning of class on the date declared.  If you cannot think
        of anything I will be glad to help you choose a project.
