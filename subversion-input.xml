  <section name="Introduction">
	  <p>
		  Building and installing from Subversion is perhaps the most difficult
			method of installing XmlPL.  You may first want to consider the other
			options listed on the <ws:link sec="download"/> page.  However, there
			are advantages.  If want access to the most bleeding edge version
			of XmlPL this is the way to get it.  Also, if you want to contribute
			to the project you should probably start here.
		</p>
	  <p>
		  To build from the <a href="http://www.subversion.org/">Subversion</a>
			repository you must have a Subversion client installed on you system.
		</p>
  </section>

  <section name="Prerequisites">
	  <p>
		  In order to build XmlPL you will need to install the same prerequisites
			as are required for the XmlPL builder install method.  See
			<ws:link sec="install" anchor="Prerequisites"/> for more information.
		</p>
	</section>
	
  <section name="Check Out the Repository">
	  <p>
		  In addition to the XmlPL repository, you will also need the
			BasicUtils library from
			the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmlcereal">XMLCereal</a>
			project.  You can attain these with the following commands.
		</p>

		<ws:code>
mkdir xmlpl
cd xmlpl
svn co https://xmlcereal.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xmlcereal/trunk/BasicUtils libbasicutils
svn co https://xmlpl.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xmlpl/trunk .
		</ws:code>
  </section>

  <section name="Build &amp; Install the Packages">
	  <p>
		  The XmlPL compiler tools are made up of a number of packages.  You must
			build and install these in the following order.
	  </p>

	  <ul>
		  <li>libbasicutils</li>
			<li>libantlr</li>
			<li>libxmlpl_cpp_runtime</li>
			<li>xmlplcc</li>
			<li>libxmlpl_cpp_standard</li>
			<li>xmlpl</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
		  The packages can be built with the following commands.
		</p>

		<ws:code>
cd &lt;package directory&gt;
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix &lt;install path&gt;
make
make install
cd ..
		</ws:code>

		<p>
		  If you want to install directly to your system paths then you
			may omit the <inline>--prefix &lt;install path&gt;</inline>
			option.  Otherwise, you should ensure that <inline>&lt;install
			path&gt;</inline> is listed in your <inline>PATH</inline>
			environment variable so that the other packages can find their
			installed dependencies. You may also need to set your
			<inline>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</inline>.  You can use the following
			commands to achieve this.
		</p>
		<ws:code>
export PATH=$PATH:&lt;install path&gt;/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&lt;install path&gt;/lib
		</ws:code>

    <p>
		  Of course you must replace <inline>&lt;install
			path&gt;</inline> with your actual install path.
