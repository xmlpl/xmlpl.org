  <h1>XmlPL Licensing Overview</h1>

  <p>
    <ws:link sec="gpl">GPL</ws:link> for free.
    <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD</a>
    for a fee.
  </p>

  <p>
    XmlPL is a business friendly Open-Source project.  For this reason we
    provide <b>multiple licensing options</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
   For the Open-Source community and those just curious we offer XmlPL under
   the <ws:link sec="gpl">GNU Public License</ws:link>.  The consequence of
   this is that any <b>published</b> software developed using XmlPL under
   this license must also be licensed under the <ws:link sec="gpl">GNU Public
   License</ws:link> which requires public disclosure of your source code.
   This is the cost of "free software".
  </p>

  <p>
    Like many software business we are funded by selling software and related
    services such as support contracts and consulting.
  </p>

  <p>
    For many businesses
    sharing company source code with the world is not an option.  This makes
    the <ws:link sec="gpl">GNU Public License</ws:link> undesirable.
  </p>

  <p>
    For these reasons we also offer XmlPL with a <b>business friendly</b>
    license, such as the BSD license, generally combined with a
    <b>support agreement</b>.  For more information email
    <ws:email address="info@xmlpl.org"/>.
